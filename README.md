<b>d3.gpx</b> is a lightweight GPS track viewer for GPX files written in D3.js. Drag-and-drop a GPX file anywhere and start visualizing your tracks!

It features an interpolating time slider with multi-level scrubbing (similar to the one you see in the iPhone/iPad music app), and can be activated by holding onto the circular slider handle and moving your mouse down before sliding left or right. Currently, there are 4 levels of scrubbing indicated by 4 different circle sizes â€“ the further your mouse is away from the slider the smaller the circle and the finer the scrubbing will be.
